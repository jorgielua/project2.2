<h2>Reasons Why Animals Should Be 
  Free!!
    </h2>
      <ul> <h2>

    
    <li>Back in 2015 two zoo keeper's in Copenhagen Zoo surprised many people by shooting a healthy young giraffe,and feeding it remains to lion in the plubic, this is so disgusting.</li>
       <li><h2> According to Freedom of animals :Zoos cannot begin to provide the amount of space animals have in the wild. Tigers and lions have around 18,000 times less space in zoos than they would in the wild</h2></li>
       <li>Animals in zoo's are living in cramped positions or sick or dead on display.</li>
        <li><h2>The animals know that they are getting treated bad and start then start to act sad like elephants would  sway their heads from side to side as they stand rooted to the spot. These ‘stereotypic behaviours’ are a sign of mental distress, brought on by captivity.</h2></li>

  </ul>

<h2> What you can do to take action is strike and protest at the La Zoo or donate to the Freedom Of Animals page. The money will could help produce campaign materials for protests at events exploiting animals,help us to convince companies to ditch live animal events to protect animals,and fund an investigator to expose animal suffering at a mobile zoo display.</h2>
